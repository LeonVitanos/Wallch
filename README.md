# Wallch

This is my first project, in which i took my first steps of programming together with a friend, at the age of 15. The development was active from 2010 until 2015 and was stopped mainly because we didn't admire the code we've written while learning to program and also wanted to move to other projects.

It served as a wallpaper changer from images stored on the hard drive, but what made it popular to the Linux community, was some unique features, like the [Live Earth Wallpaper](https://www.die.net/earth/rectangular.html?zoom=2) and [Wikipedia's Picture Of The Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day). In order for those features to work, we had a Raspberry Pi powered on all the time and running scripts which were downloading, processing (merging live weather images, downsizing, etc...) and uploading the corresponding images 24/7.

With the help of an [OMG! Ubuntu! article](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/03/spare-10-minutes-help-translate-test-wallpaper-app-wallch), Wallch has been translated to more than 7 languages!

### Downloads

Wallch counts 50k+ downloads at the [sourceforge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wall-changer/), not counting downloads from the ppas or from the Ubuntu Software Center (where most people download apps), which is pretty neat! :squirrel:
