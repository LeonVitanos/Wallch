 * \brief A class for creating image snapshots of websites.
 *
 * The WebsiteSnapshot class gives you the ability to
 * create snapshots of web pages. It also supports
 * log-in, so as to take a snapshot of a page which needs
 * special access (cookies).
 *
 * WebsiteSnapshot creates a custom QWebPage object which
 * does not allow prompts created from javascript, for example.
 *
 * If no user authentication (log-in) is required, WebsiteSnapshot
 * loads the specified URL and then renders an image using the main
 * frame of the custom QWebPage.
 *
 * If user authentication is required, WebsiteSnapshot loads through
 * its custom QWebPage the log-in page, searches for and fills the
 * username and password fields and calls a QEvent equivalent to
 * pressing the Return key. This causes a log-in attempt to the website.
 * After the page has loaded, WebsiteSnapshot loads the final page
 * that needs to be snapshoted and takes the snapshot of it. If the final
 * page is equal to the log-in page, then WebsiteSnapshot will use the page
 * where it is redirected after the log-in, for taking the snapshot.

     * Note that complex authentication will fail in the following cases:
     *   - The website does not use common username-password authentication.
     *   - The log-in page does not use common input username-password ids.
     *
     * When searching the log-in page for the appropriate username-password input fields, WebsiteSnapshot
     * actually searches for the id attribute of <input> tags.

     *   - For usernames:
     *     "username", "user", "email", "Email", "User", "Username", "signin-email", "userid", "user-id",
     *     "navbar_username", "login_email", "loginUsername", "id_nickname", "id_email", "session_key-login",
     *     "ap_email", "signup_email".

     *   - For passwords:
     *     "password", "pass", "passwd", "Password", "Pass", "Passwd", "signin-password", "navbar_password",
     *     "login_password", "navbar_password_hint", "passid", "pass-id", "loginPassword", "id_password",
     *     "pwd", "session_password-login", "ap_password", "signup_password".
     *

     * then please refer to @a setComplexAuthenticationWithPossibleFields().
